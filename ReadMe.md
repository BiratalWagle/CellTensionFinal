# How to set up to use this code. 

First go to the Cellpose_Main file. This file will facilitate training the images which will create the _seg.npy files which are required for the Cellopose_Displacement_SCA_2 File. For testing, the files already present in the github repo should be fine.

The Cellpose_Displacement_SCA_2.ipynb file does the edge detection, and cell selection for 
SINGLE CELL ABLATIION. 

Cellpose_Displacement_New includes a new method of obtaining the vertexes and displacement. By far it is the most accurate method of the 3 Cellpose_Displacement Methods
